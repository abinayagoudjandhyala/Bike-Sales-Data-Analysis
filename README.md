# Bike Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes customer data to provide insights into bike purchasing behavior, focusing on factors such as average income, age brackets, and commute distances. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, with visual representations created through dashboards and pivot tables.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between customer attributes and their likelihood of purchasing a bike. The analysis focuses on three key areas:
- **Average Income per Purchase**: Understanding how income levels impact bike purchase decisions.
- **Customer Age Brackets**: Analyzing which age groups are more likely to buy bikes.
- **Customer Commute Distance**: Investigating the effect of commute distance on bike purchasing behavior.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following sheets:
1. **Original Data**: The raw data before any cleaning or transformations.
2. **Cleaned Data**: Data after preprocessing, ready for analysis.
3. **Pivot Table**: Summarized data for deriving insights.
4. **Dashboard**: Visual representations (charts) highlighting the key insights.

## Key Findings

### 1. Average Income per Purchase
- **Analysis**: Customers with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes.
- **Key Insight**: The average income of customers who purchased bikes is significantly higher compared to those who did not.

### 2. Customer Age Brackets
- **Analysis**: The majority of bike purchases come from customers in the **Middle Age** group.
- **Key Insight**: Middle-aged customers (35-55 years) show the highest purchase rates.

### 3. Customer Commute Distance
- **Analysis**: Commute distance impacts bike purchasing behavior.
- **Key Insight**: Customers commuting **0-1 miles** are more likely to purchase bikes, while those with longer commutes show decreasing purchase trends.

## Conclusion/Insights

- **Income**: Higher income correlates positively with bike purchases.
- **Age Brackets**: Middle-aged customers (35-55) are the most likely to purchase bikes.
- **Commute**: Shorter commute distances (0-1 miles) are linked to higher bike purchase rates.
